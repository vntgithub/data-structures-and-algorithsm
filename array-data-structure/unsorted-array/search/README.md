# C++ Program: Search for an Element in a List
This C++ program allows you to input a list of integers and then searches for a specific number within that list. Once found, it prints the index (position) of that number.
# How to Run the Program
Compile the Code:
Save the provided code into a file (e.g., search.cpp).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
```
g++ -o search search.cpp
```

Run the Program:
1. Execute the compiled program:
```
./search
```

2. Provide Input:
- Enter the size of the list and the number you want to search for (e.g., 10 5).
- Enter the list elements (e.g., 1 3 2 5 9).
4. Observe Output:
- The program will search for the specified number in the list.
- It will print either the index where the number is found or indicate that the number is not present.
#Example Input and Output
Suppose you run the program with the following input:

```
10 5
1 3 6 2 7 5 8 9 10 4
```

The output will be:

```
Found element 30 at index 2
```
